# Reading

## On readings books.

I try do read a couple of books around one particular topic in a streak (or at the same time). I get multiple perspectives from different authors which actually makes me understand things better.

I like to read physical books, but whenever a it's a shorter book or more of an essay I upload it to my e-reader.

When I started to read more books, I didnâ€™t really remember much from them. To get more out of books you need to _highlight_.
