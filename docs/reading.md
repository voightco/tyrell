# Reading

## On readings books.

I try do read a couple of books around one particular topic in a streak (or at the same time). I get multiple perspectives from different authors which actually makes me understand things better.

I like to read physical books, but whenever a it's a shorter book or more of an essay I upload it to my e-reader.

When I started to read more books, I didn’t really remember much from them. To get more out of books you need to _highlight_.

Video about how books are worth it. Why buy books? Because you encompass all the knowledge of one person it one go.

A book costs money but if that one idea ends up making you more money that's really valuable. Books are shortcuts to success. Get knowledge from a condensed book.

without proper citation management things are going to be a mess

You should think about what you have read, draw connections to other readings, and truly make it your own.

We want to read a lot. We want to have a high influx of information.
We want to direct our efforts at the best books (and articles) and invest only a necessary minimum of attention into the low quality content. 

Information is just an opportunity. Information means nothing if you don’t use it. 

Read the book a second time. But now you read the marked parts only. This time you make notes.

Underlining won’t help you remember; marks are there to aid understanding in a later phase of reading.

It’s useful to color-code your marks and reflect this code in your notes.

write about the interesting stuff in your own word.

The web is full of noise, and so is this fraction of the web I subscribed to. It’s up to me to find some signal.
