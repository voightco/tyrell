**Writing is thinking.** When you write you organize your ideas more effectively and it will help you have better thoughts and solve more difficult problems. As the frequency of information increases, the world becomes noisier and noisier.

## Taking notes

Your mind is for having ideas, not storing them. By taking notes on everything you 'build a second brain'; you organize (and store) your knowledge outside of your brain.

>

When you take notes on something you're reading, you're actually building the logical structure of the text's argument into the notation.

> With everything you read, ask the question -- what do I want to remember about this?

You need a way to store the thing you've read and later want to get back to.

There is no point in spending time 'filing' away notes, ordering them in groups etc. You just want to add tags and search for keywords.

## Personal problems

Some problems I'm personally having when taking notes and how this note-taking system solved them:

1. I _highlight a ton of things in books_ but I never 'process' them (coming back to them). Now I plan a book review every month where I go trough the book and put all of those highlights in this note-taking system.

2. Same goes for articles. I always keep a list of articles but I don't highlight and _only store the article not the knowledge_ withing that article. If I want to reference something I read in an article, I needed to re-read the whole article.

3. This system helped me to _journal more consistently_. Make it into a habit with a pre-defined template.

4. I jot things down without _properly linking to the original resource_. When I come back to an idea I'm not sure where I got it from and what the original source was.

## Tools for writing

The problem with most writing tools is that there is no ability to **explicitly define relationships**. Let's take a web page (or wiki) which allows for orthogonal linking between related files. It's a good start but those aren't 'real' relationships. Those links have no relationship between each other.

> The human brain is non-linear: we jump from idea to idea, all the time. Your second brain should work the same.

That's were the concept of `backlinking` comes in which allows you to create a dynamic network (graph) of relationship between notes and references. Updates and revisions are populated across the entire graph simultaneously.

> Knowledge is organized associatively, not hierarchically.

That difference in approach makes it inherently easier to store, recall, and cross-reference ideas.

> Links and connections are crucial to discovering the relations between what we know.

## Foam philosophy

Foam is a personal knowledge management and sharing system inspired by Roam Research. Built on Visual Studio Code (with extensions). The Foam prototype is built by assembling third-party extensions.

This repository is a further enhancement on the [foam-template project](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template) but also includes some principles on note-taking.

> Foam doesn’t have features in the traditional sense. Out of the box, you have access to all features of VS Code and all the Recommended Extensions you choose to install, but it’s up to you to discover what you can do with it!

## Own your content

Cloud services can shut down, get bought, or change privacy policy any day. You don't want your information held hostage (data lock-in). Foam and this Starter all markdown files sit in a local folder (with back-up to e.g. github).

They are just local markdown files, you can back-up wherever you want.

## Alternatives

- [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com): pricy, web-only. Slow to load, interface feels clunky.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): software itself is closed source and VS Code has most of the same features Obsidian has. No need for another application.
