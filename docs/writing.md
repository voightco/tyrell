## Writing
Write shitty first drafts. Get your first draft out there as soon as possible.

If you practice writing every day, it’ll come easy to get words on paper when you’re under pressure to complete a writing project.

Track your writing and progress, how many words? When do you write best at what time?

The more you write, the more you develop your style.

Use outlines (for hierarchy) and rewrite later. Reference notes and links instead of pasting their content. 

Prepare Research First, Compile a Draft Second. A zettelkasten can help with your research.

Whatever you put in can be used at any later time. You won’t ever produce any waste during your research but instead expand your knowledge base without even trying to do so.

We don’t use the perfect words in a perfect matter – instead, we humans are messy and make mistakes all the time, so we need to clean up afterwards.

Finishing a writing project isn’t just about the typing. There is composing, and there is editing. I understand composing to be additive, that is, whenever you compose, you add new stuff to your text. Editing is mostly subtractive, though.

Publishing early and publishing often seems to be a good idea still.
